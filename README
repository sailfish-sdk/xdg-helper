XDG Base Directory Specification Helper
---------------------------------------

This small helper library can be used to determine application-specific
configuration, data and cache directories that follow the XDG Base
Directory Specification:

http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

See README.* for alternatives if you already use libraries in your app.
